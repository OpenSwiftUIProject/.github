# OpenSwiftUI Project

Welcome to **OpenSwiftUI Project** ‚Äì a community-driven initiative focused on building a cross-platform implementation of SwiftUI.

Our goal is to extend SwiftUI beyond Apple platforms while also providing access to hidden APIs for debugging and enhancing SwiftUI development on Apple platforms.

## üöÄ Mission

At **OpenSwiftUI**, we aim to:

- Build a cross-platform SwiftUI implementation to enable UI development across multiple environments.
- Provide access to hidden or internal APIs to help developers debug and optimize SwiftUI on Apple platforms.
- Create an open, collaborative space for SwiftUI developers to contribute to and benefit from these efforts.
